### Review Prototypes/Inheritance

In the [prototype / inheritance](../overview/prototypes-inheritance.md) section we talked setting up and adding to prototypes.

```javascript
// Contruct the prototype. 
function PrototypicalGreeting(greeting = "Hello", name = "World") {
  this.greeting = greeting
  this.name = name
}

// Add the return to the prototype.
PrototypicalGreeting.prototype.greet = function() {
  return `${this.greeting}, ${this.name}!`
}

const greetProto = new PrototypicalGreeting("Hey", "folks")
console.log(greetProto.greet()) // Hey Folks

```

The most important difference between classes and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a _type_ which can be **instantiated at runtime**, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.

A child of an ES6 class is another _type_ definition which extends the parent with new properties and methods, which in turn can be **instantiated at runtime**. A child of a prototype is another object _instance_ which delegates to the parent any properties that arenâ€™t implemented on the child.

Let's look at classes.

```javascript
class ClassicalGreeting {
  constructor(greeting = "Hello", name = "World") {
    this.greeting = greeting
    this.name = name
  }

  greet() {
    return `${this.greeting}, ${this.name}!`
  }
}

const classyGreeting = new ClassicalGreeting("Hey", "folks")

console.log(classyGreeting.greet())
```
