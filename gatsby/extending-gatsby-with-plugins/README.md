# Plugins

Gatsby plugins are like Drupal modules.  They help you extend your website's functionality.  Plugins are typically NPM packages you can easily install and configure.  Whether you need SEO functionality, or responsive images, or social media integration, chances are there is a plugin for that.

Gatsby's library of plugins continues to grow and the community behind it does a really great job at ensuring a quality list of plugins.
