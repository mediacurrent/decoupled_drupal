# Welcome
This is a hands-on training workshop by [Mediacurrent](https://mediacurrent).

This training will cover an array of Javascript concepts that are valuable on their own, but also help you confidently get the most out of front-end libraries like React.

## Training objective

Main objectives of the training are to identify all the pieces involved in building a fully decoupled Drupal site where the Front-end is simply consuming the content provided by Drupal and can be built completely independently of Drupal. For the purpose of this training we have chosento use GatsbyJS as the Front-end framework, but this could also be done with other frameworks such as NextJS, AngularJS, etc.
