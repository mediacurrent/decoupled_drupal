# What is JavaScript?

Javascript could be primarily considered the language that we use to interact with web browsers.  It is made to run in browsers and can communicate fully with CSS/HTML.  Currently, JS is also used in a variety of other environments, such as on servers as Node.js.  

As you learn JS, any time you think it is difficult or weird, don't worry!  It was created in only a few weeks and has some quirks compared to other classical programming languages.

Javascript is defined the [ECMAScript Spec](https://tc39.es/ecma262/) and maintained by [ECMA TC 39](https://github.com/tc39) group.
